		<img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9bca1cb589a9a99ec6b6f6cb6095c740.png" id="gravatar"> 
		<p>I have a background in small business and e-commerce.  After running my own contracting business for five years, I decided to change jobs and started working for a small e-commerce company.  Once there, I took up an interest in programming and web development and liked it so much that I decided to make a full on career change.</p>
		
		<p>I've lived in the suburbs of Chicago my whole life, therefore I'm a die-hard Chicago Bears fan (notice the color scheme). Hopefully, by 2015 we will have a repeat of the 1985 Superbowl Champions.  I think it's about time for another championship.</p>

			
		<p>I'm engaged to my high school sweetheart, 12 years running, and we are getting married next fall. Being that we both have demanding lives Monday thru Friday, we like to make the most out of our weekends.  Traveling is our biggest enjoyment. We've taken numerous road trips all over the United States. My favorite route was from our hometown to Niagara Falls. This trip took us through the Allegheny National Forest and through the foothills of western New York.  The Kinzua Bridge which we visited on this trip, was featured on an episode of Finding Bigfoot several weeks after we got home (I think that belongs in the story about this trip).  Of course, the actual falls of Niagara were exciting to see. Seeing movies is another pasttime we endulge in, and I'm a self-proclaimed movie critic.</p> 


		<p>I'm a learning enthusiast and I love to take on new challenges.  If you'd like to learn more about me, check out my resume, projects, or shoot me an email.</p>
