	<h2 class="project-name">Restaurant Management System</h2>
	<p class="description">This app was created to serve 2 types of users: restaurants, and their customers.</p>

	<p class="description">A restaurant user signs up, uploads a menu and creates a custom floorplan, which customers can then use to check into a particular seat, order food, and even pay with their smartphone. This allows tabs to easily be split amongst friends, the digitization of restaurant sales and customer information, and restaurant logistics (such as how long a particular user spends at restaurants)</p>

	<p class="description">Planned features: integrate google maps with the restaurants saved in the database, allowing customers to see the restaurants nearest to them, their menu, specials, and even wait times.</p>

	<p class="description">Total Time worked on Project: 8 days, it was our DBC final project</p>
